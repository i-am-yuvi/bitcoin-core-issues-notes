# [#31907](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31907), qa: clarify and document one assumeutxo test case with malleated snapshot

# Background
The feature_assumeutxo.py functional test checks various errors with malleated snapshots. Some of these cases are brittle or use confusing and undocumented values. Fix one of those by using a clear, documented and forward-compatible value.

I ran across those when working on an unrelated changeset which affected the snapshot. 
It took me a while to understand where the seemingly magic byte string was coming from, so i figured it was worth proposing this patch on its own for the sake of making the test more maintainable.

# Testing the changes
- Run the functional tests
```
./test/functional/test_runner.py feature_assumeutxo.py
```
 or 
```
./test/functional/test_runner.py
```

- Test with different amounts
```
# Test with precisely MAX_MONEY + 1
ser_varint(compress_amount(MAX_MONEY + 1)) + ser_varint(0)

# Test with very large value
ser_varint(compress_amount(MAX_MONEY * 2)) + ser_varint(0)
```

- Test boundary condition
```
# Test with MAX_MONEY (should crash)
valid_amount = ser_varint(compress_amount(MAX_MONEY)) + ser_varint(0)
```

- Verify the (de)serialization

```
valid_bytes = ser_varint(compress_amount(MAX_MONEY)) + ser_varint(0)
invalid_bytes = ser_varint(compress_amount(MAX_MONEY + 1)) + ser_varint(0)

print(f"Valid amount bytes: {valid_bytes.hex()}")
print(f"Invalid amount bytes: {invalid_bytes.hex()}")
```
