# test: Fix authproxy named args debug logging


In Python, when a function accepts both positional(*args) and keyword(**argsn) arguments, for which args is handled as a tuple and argsn as dictionary where Python doesn't 
merge them automatically into a combined list.

## The issue
The RPC server accepts a single call which includes both positional as well as keyword. 
That means if a caller provides both, the server expects to receive both types together. In that case, the original code(logging part) ignores the *argsn* when there were *args* present - hiding the fact that both kinds were sent. 
This leads to debugging ambiguity because the debug log might not show the complete set of parameters the RPC server receives.

I could see the difference:
`-1-> getblockcount {}` - without changes

`-1-> getblockcount [] {}` - with changes

### Helper Method for json.dumps
This helper function makes sense that instead of using repetitive code which might cause inconsistencies this will wrap json.dumps so that every part of code uses uniform serialization.
